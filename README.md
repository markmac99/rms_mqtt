# Monitoring and RMS camera with MQ 

If you are running OpenHAB, Home Assistant or a similar home automation software you can monitor the RMS meteor camera with [MQTT](https://mqtt.org/).  MQTT is a lightweight messaging protocol widely used in the IoT (Internet of Things) world to communicate between smart devices. For example using MQTT your home automation software can monitor and control smart plugs, switches, weatherstations, doorbells and so forth.

This code is in support of that approach. For full instructions see [here](https://github.com/markmac99/ukmon-pitools/wiki/Monitoring_with_MQTT)
